# Serverless-web-app-using-AWS
The Serverless Task Tracker Application is a simple web-based application built using AWS serverless services. It allows users to securely log in, create tasks, and view a list of their tasks. The project demonstrates how frontend, backend, authentication, and database layers can be integrated without managing servers.
